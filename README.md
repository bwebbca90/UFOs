# UFOs

## Project Definition
We aim to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. The website is required to be user fiendly and easily filtered by date, shape, or by location fields. 

## Project Results
The website can be filtered with the following options:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Any of these filters may be used concurrently or individually. Here, we see we have filtered for "1/13/2010", "US", and "triangle" and we have one result that took place within White Oak, Pennsylvania.

## Project Improvements
This website is functional, however, the filters are not optimized. The filters retain a "default" search, and are not cleared. They are also reliant upon the user knowing what dates, shapes, and locations are available rather than a drop down selection, which would be more user friendly. By clearing these filters and optimizing them for the user experience, the website will become significantly more functional.
